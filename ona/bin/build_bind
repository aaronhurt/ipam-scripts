#
# THIS IS A REFERENCE DESIGN BUILD SCRIPT, IT WORKS FOR ME BUT MAY NOT FOR YOU
# IT IS INTENDED TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW A SCRIPT LIKE THIS COULD BE BUILT.  IF IT WORKS
# FOR YOU, GREAT!  IF NOT THEN MAKE WHATEVER ADJUSTMENTS TO IT YOU NEED TO GET IT WORKING!
# ASK FOR HELP IN THE FORUMS IF NEEDED.
#
#
# REQUIRES: dcm.pl, build_bind_server_domain_list module, build_bind_domain module and build_bind_conf module, working rndc for the local server,
#
# Since this script must restart the named daemon, it should be ran as the bind user or as root.
#
# dcm.pl should be working on your system and either in your path or you will need to put the full path to it in the DCM_PATH variable below.
# You will need to have a user in the ONA system defined as "sys_build".. that user should have only read permissions and not update permissions.
#
# The tools rndc and named-checkconf must be in your path as well.
#
# Remember that the checks done by named-checkconf are only syntax checks.  They will not ensure that the content of your files is correct.
# If you have missing records or incorrect data it could impact your environment or the functionality of other domain servers.
#
# The local host name as determined using "hostname -f" must match the FQDN of the server in ONA.  It must be the PRIMARY name, not an CNAME
# or alternate A record.
#
# For ease of use, it is recommended to add /opt/ona/bin to your $PATH environment variable
#
# Add the following line to your system named.conf file. Probably in /etc/bind/named.conf or named.conf.local depending on your system.
# The placement of this line could vary depending on how your distro organizes named.  named.conf.local should be used for ubuntu/debian based systems.
#
#     include "/opt/ona/etc/bind/named.conf.ona";
#
# You will need to execute the following dcm commands to automatically create the appropriate module entries:
#
# dcm.pl -r add_module name=build_bind_server_domain_list desc="List domains associated with a server" file=build/build_bind.inc.php
# dcm.pl -r add_module name=build_bind_domain desc="Build a BIND DNS zone file" file=build/build_bind.inc.php
# dcm.pl -r add_module name=build_bind_conf desc="Build BIND DNS config file" file=build/build_bind.inc.php
#
# NOTE: this script was developed and tested on an ubuntu box.  Your mileage may vary on other distros.
# NOTE: On my ubuntu box I had to modify the apparmor configuration in /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.named to include "/opt/ona/etc/bind/** r,"
# NOTE: to view example configs in the GUI you need to set build_dns_type to "bind" in the sys_config table
#
