Upgrades prior to version 08.02.18 must be manually done by loading the file install/PRE-v08.02.18-to-08.02.18.sql into the database. 
This upgrade step has not been tested and likly has errors.

If you are currently on v08.02.18 and you are upgrading to version v08.04.15 then you must load the following sql file:

mysql -u <adminuser> -p ona < install/v08.02.18-to-v08.04.15.sql

Updates after version v08.04.15 should automatically process.

Also, each time you install a new tar archive, you will most likly need to change
permissions on the /opt/ona/www/local/config directory to whatever your webserver user is.

This can be done with the following command, as an example:
chown www-data /opt/ona/www/local/config
