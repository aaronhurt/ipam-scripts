#
#
# THIS IS A REFERENCE DESIGN BUILD SCRIPT, IT WORKS FOR ME BUT MAY NOT FOR YOU
# IT IS INTENDED TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW A SCRIPT LIKE THIS COULD BE BUILT.  IF IT WORKS
# FOR YOU, GREAT!  IF NOT THEN MAKE WHATEVER ADJUSTMENTS TO IT YOU NEED TO GET IT WORKING!
# ASK FOR HELP IN THE FORUMS IF NEEDED.
#
# REQUIRES: dcm.pl, build_dhcpd_conf module, working ISC dhcpd for the local server, sendEmail
#
# Since this script must restart the dhcpd daemon, it should be ran as the dhcp user or as root.
#
# dcm.pl should be working on your system and either in your path or you will need to put the full path to it in the DCM_PATH variable below.
# You will need to have a user in the ONA system defined as "sys_build".. that user should have only read permissions and not update permissions.
#
# Remember that the checks done by dhcpd -t are only syntax checks.  They will not ensure that the content of your files is correct.
# If you have missing records or incorrect data it could impact your environment.
#
# The local host name as determined using "hostname -f" must match the FQDN of the server in ONA.  It must be the PRIMARY name, not an CNAME
# or alternate A record.
#
# For ease of use, it is recommended to add /opt/ona/bin to your $PATH environment variable
#
# Add the following line to your system dhcpd.conf file. Probably in /etc/dhcpd3/dhcpd.conf depending on your system.
# You may need to configure directives like "authoritative", ddns-update-style, or logging statements etc in the main config file as these are
# out of scope for the ONA system to manage at this point.
# The placement of this line could vary depending on how your distro organizes dhcpd.  /etc/dhcpd3/dhcpd.conf should be used for ubuntu/debian based systems.
#
#     include "/opt/ona/etc/dhcpd/dhcpd.conf.ona";
#
# You will need to execute the following dcm command to automatically create the appropriate module entries:
#
# dcm.pl -r add_module name=build_dhcpd_conf desc="Build ISC DHCPD config file" file=build/build_dhcpd.inc.php
#
# NOTE: this script was developed and tested on an ubuntu box.  Your mileage may vary on other distros.
# NOTE: Some distros use the Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP) version of dhcp config file instead, be aware of that.
# NOTE: to view example configs in the GUI you need to set build_dhcp_type to "isc" or "dhcpd" in the sys_config table
#
# Batch mode [-b] is used to remotely execute this script and return a SUCCESS or FAILURE message only.  This can be
# used by an ssh key execution for example.
